            <h6>HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real world</h6>
            <h5>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h5>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Transforms</strong><br>
                        The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.
                        We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions. The value of the transform property is one or more
                        transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they’re provided.<br>
                        <strong>Translation</strong><br>
                        Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior
                        of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y
                        axes.
                        <section class="ex">
                            transform: translate(45px, -45px);
                            -webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android 4.4.3, BB10 */
                            -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */
                            transform: translate(45px,-45px);
                        </section>
                        <strong>Scaling</strong><br>
                        The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is
                        provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while
                        maintaining the original aspect ratio.<br>
                        <section class="ex">
                            transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);
                        </section>
                        <strong>Rotation</strong><br>
                        The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale, by
                        default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees
                        moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise.<br>
                        <section class="ex">
                            transform: rotate(10deg);
                        </section>
                        <strong>Skew</strong><br>
                        The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis,
                        and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis:
                        <section class="ex">
                            transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);
                        </section>
                        <strong>Changing the Origin of the Transform</strong><br>
                        As we hinted at earlier, you can control the origin from which your transforms are applied. This is done using the
                        transform-origin property.<br>
                        <strong>Note: Choose Your Ordering Carefully</strong><br>
                        <strong>Support for Internet Explorer 8 and Earlier</strong><br>
                        <strong>Transitions</strong><br>
                        Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
                        We can animate any of the transforms we’ve just seen, so that our pages feel more dynamic.
                        <section class="ex">
                            Steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:<br>
                            
                            1.Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.<br>
                            2.Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.<br>
                            3.Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including:
                            transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these
                            and how they work shortly.
                        </section>
                        <i>transition-property</i><br>
                        The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all
                        properties being the default.<br>
                        <i>The transition-duration Property</i><br>
                        The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the
                        default state to the transitioned state.
                        <section class="ex">transition-duration: 0.2s;</section>
                        <i>The transition-timing-function Property</i><br>
                        The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. Do you want
                        your animation to start off slow and become faster, start off fast and end slower, advance at an even keel, or some
                        other variation?<br>
                        The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out.<br>
                        ease has a slow start, then it speeds up, and ends slowly.<br>
                        ease-in-out is similar to ease, but accelerates more sharply at the beginning.<br>
                        linear creates a transition that animates at a constant speed. <br>
                        ease-in creates a transition that is slow to start but gains speed, then stops abruptly.<br>

                        <section class="ex">transition-timing-function: ease-out;</section>
                        <strong>Property</strong><br>
                        Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins.
                        Normally a transition begins immediately, so the default is 0. Include the number of milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s) to
                        delay the transition.<br>
                        <section class="ex">
                            -webkit-transition-delay: 50ms;<br>
                            transition-delay: 50ms;<br>
                        </section>
                        <strong>The transition Shorthand Property</strong><br>
                        <section class="ex">
                            .ad-ad2 h1 span {
                            transition-property: transform;<br>
                            transition-duration: 0.2s;<br>
                            transition-timing-function: ease-out;<br>
                            transition-delay: 50ms;
                            }<br>

                            transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
                            }
                        </section>
                        <strong>Multiple Transitions</strong><br>
                        <strong>Animations</strong><br>
                        Transitions animate elements over time; however, they’re limited in what they can do. You can define starting and ending
                        states, but there’s no fine-grained control over any intermediate states. CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you
                        to control each step of an animation via keyframes.<br>
                        <strong>Keyframes</strong><br>
                        To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s
                        property declaration block. Animations in themselves don’t do anything; in order to animate an element, you’ll need to
                        associate the animation with that element.<br>
                        There are two keyterms― from and to ―which evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively. These values specify how far along the
                        animation each keyframe is located.<br>
                        <section class="ex">
                            @keyframes moveRight {<br>

                            transform: translateX(-50%);<br>
                            }<br>
                            to {<br>
                            transform: translateX(50%);<br>
                            }<br>
