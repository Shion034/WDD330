                        <strong>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</strong><br>
                        Errors are caused by one of the following:<br>
                        System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.<br>
                        Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.<br>
                        User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.<br>
                        <strong>Linting Tools</strong><br>
                        Linting tools such as JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply
                        using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain
                        if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.<br>
                        <strong>Debugging Tools</strong><br>
                        Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at
                        certain points. You can then see the values of all the variables at those points and modify them.
