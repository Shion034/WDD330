                    <p><h6>Ch8:Forms</h6><br>
                    Forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>*Form Controls</strong><br>
                    input: fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads<br>
                    select: menus for drop-down lists of options<br>
                    textarea: elements for longer text entry<br>
                    button: elements for submitting and resetting forms<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>*Form Validation</strong><br>
                    Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly. Examples of
                    the types of validation that occur include ensuring that:<br>
                    ・A required field is completed<br>
                    
                    ・An email address is valid<br>
                    
                    ・A number is entered when numerical data is required<br>
                    
                    ・A password is at least a minimum number of characters<br>
<br>
                    <h6>Ch12:Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h6>
                    Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects
                    that have properties and methods.This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout
                    the life of the program.<br>
                    <strong>*Encapsulation</strong><br>
                    the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user,
                    such as the 'on' button. In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods
                    available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.<br>
                    <strong>*Polymorphism</strong><br>
                    the concept of polymorphism: the same process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means various objects can
                    share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.<br>
                    <strong>*Inheritance</strong><br>
                    the concept of inheritance: taking the features of one object then adding some new features. In OOP, this means we can
                    take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods.<br>
                    <strong>*Classes</strong><br>
                    Many object-oriented languages, such as Java and Ruby, are known as class-based languages.JavaScript didn't have classes before ES6, and used the concept of using actual objects as the blueprint for creating
                    more objects. This is known as a prototype-based language.The juicers based on the prototype would be able to do everything the prototype could do, with some being able to do
                    even more.<br>
                    <strong>*Summaries for Classes</strong><br>
                    ・Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization, shared properties and methods.<br>
                    
                    ・Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class declaration after it’s been defined can be added
                    to the prototype. These will be added to all instances, even those that have already been created.<br>
                    
                    ・Add any properties or methods that are individual to a particular instance can be augmented using assignment to that
                    object (a mixin could be used to add multiple properties at once, as we’ll see later).<br>
                    
                    ・Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor class needs to be reset.<br>
                    <strong>*Polymorhism</strong><br>
                    The concept of polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method, but implement it in different ways.
                    <br>
                    <h6>Ch15:Modern JavaScript Development</h6>
                    <strong>*Libraries</strong><br>
                    A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks.
                    Using a library means you can be confident that your code will be as bullet-proof as possible in many browsers.In addition, there will usually be lots of online documentation and a strong community ready to help out if you become
                    stuck.<br>
                    <strong>*Default Exports</strong><br>
                    Default exports refer to a single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be
                    explicitly named. The syntax for default exports is purposely easier to read because this is how modules were designed
                    to be used.<br>
                    <strong>*npm</strong><br>
                    The Node Package Manager was developed soon after Node.js was introduced to allow JavaScript code to be shared by
                    developers. It has since grown into the largest repository of code libraries available.<br>
