                    <h5>Ch 9:The Window Object </h5>
                    <strong>The Browser Object Model</strong><br>
                    <strong>Going Global</strong><br>
                    Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the window
                    object.<br>
                    <strong>Dialogs</strong><br>
                    <strong>Browser Information</strong><br>
                    <strong>Location, Location, Location</strong><br>
                    The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a
                    number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.
                     <section class="ex">
                        window.location.href
                        << "https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"
                        window.location.protocol 
                        << "https:"
                        window.location.host
                        << "www.sitepoint.com"
                        window.location.hostname
                        << "www.sitepoint.com"
                        window.location.pathname
                        << "/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"
                        window.location.origin
                        << "https://www.sitepoint.com"
                    </section>
                    The window.location object also has the following methods:<br>
                    ・The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true, it will force
                    the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.<br>
                    ・The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:<br>
                    <section class="ex">
                        window.location.assign('https://www.sitepoint.com/')
                    </section>
                    ・The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in the
                    session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.<br>
                    ・The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:<br>
                    <strong>The Browser History</strong><br>
                    The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser
                    session.<br>
                    <strong>Controlling Windows</strong><br>
                    <strong>Screen Information</strong><br>
                    The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You can find out the height
                    and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties respectively:
                    <section class="ex">
                    window.screen.height
                    << 1024 
                    window.screen.width 
                    << 1280
                    </section>
                    <strong>The Document Object</strong><br>
                    <i>document.write()</i><br>
                    The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it will completely replace
                    the current document:
                    <section class="ex">document.write('<h1>Hello, world!</h1>');</section>
                    <strong>Timing Functions</strong><br>
                    <i>setTimeout()</i><br>
                    The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing
                    functions at regular intervals.
                    
                    The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as
                    its second parameter.
                    <strong>Animation</strong><br>

                    <h5>Ch 14:HTML5 APIs </h5>
                    HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create web pages. The latest iteration is HTML 5.1,
                    which finally became a W3C recommendation in November 2016.<br>
                    <strong>HTML5 APIs</strong><br>
                    The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries,
                    geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers
                    access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.<br>
                    <strong>HTML5 Web Storage</strong><br>
                    <strong>Geolocation</strong><br>
                    The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the
                    user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can
                    then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel.<br>
                    <strong>Web Workers</strong><br>
                    We saw in earlier chapters that JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process can run at one
                    time. Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript. The idea is
                    that any processes that could take a long time are carried out in the background, so a website will continue to function
                    without fear of the dreaded 'script has become unresponsive' message that occurs when a script runs for too long, shown
                    below.<br>
                    <strong>A Factorizing Example</strong><br>
                    <strong>Websockets</strong><br>
                    Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This means
                    that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.
                    
                    To see this in action, we’ll create a mini-messaging application that uses the websocket protocol to communicate with an
                    Echo server. This sends a response that is exactly the same as the message it receives.<br>
                    <a href="websockets/websocket.html">Websockets message app</a>
                    <strong>Notifications</strong><br>
                    The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner
                    of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system notification is that
                    they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current tab.<br>
                    <strong>Multimedia</strong><br>
                    <strong>Other APIs</strong><br>
                    The list of APIs is constantly growing, and includes APIs for accessing a device’s camera, uploading files, accessing
                    the battery status, handling push notifications, building drag-and-drop functionality, creating 3D effects with WebGL,
                    and many more! A comprehensive list of HTML5 APIs can be found at the Mozilla Developer Network.<br>
                    <strong>Drawing with Canvas</strong><br>
                    The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript. A canvas
                    element is a rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate system that starts at (0,0) in the top-left
                    corner. To add a canvas element to a page, the canvas tag is used specifying a height and width. Anything placed
                    inside the tag will only display if the canvas element is unsupported:<br>
                    <section class="ex">
                        <canvas id='canvas' width='400' height='400'>Sorry, but your browser does not support the canvas element</canvas>
                        <script>
                            const canvasElement = document.getElementById('canvas');
                            const context = canvasElement.getContext('2d');
                            context.fillStyle = "#0000cc"; // a blue fill color 
                            context.strokeStyle = "#ccc"; // a gray stroke color
                            context.lineWidth = 4;
                            context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 50);
                            context.strokeRect(10, 100, 100, 50);

                            context.beginPath();
                                context.moveTo(130, 50);
                                context.lineTo(180, 50);
                                context.moveTo(155, 50);
                                context.lineTo(155, 90);
                                context.strokeStyle = '#c00';
                                context.lineWidth = 15;
                                context.stroke();

                            context.beginPath();
                                context.arc(200, 200, 30, 0, Math.PI * 2, false);
                                context.strokeStyle = '#ff0';
                                context.lineWidth = 4;
                                context.stroke();

                            context.fillStyle = '#0c0'; // a blue fill color
                                context.font = 'bold 26px sans-serif';
                                context.fillText('Hello', 20, 200);
                        </script>
