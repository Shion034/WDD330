            <h5>Further Function</h5>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Function Properties and Methods</strong><br>
                        <strong>Call and Apply Methods</strong><br>
                        <strong>Custom Properties</strong><br>
                        There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any
                        object in JavaScript. For example, you could add a description property to a function that describes what it does.<br>
                        <strong>Memoization</strong><br>
                        A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or memoization.
                        If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property. Then if the same
                        argument is used again later, we can return the value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again.<br>
                        <strong>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</strong><br>
                        An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name
                        suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined.<br>
                        <strong>Temporary Variables</strong><br>
                        <strong>Initialization Code</strong><br>
                        <strong>Safe Use of Strict Mode</strong><br>
                        <strong>Creating Self-contained Code Blocks</strong><br>
                        <strong>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</strong><br>
                        The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call itself, but define itself, and even
                        redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.<br>
                        <strong>Init-Time Branching</strong><br>
                        <strong>Recursive Functions</strong><br>
                        A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It’s a useful tool to use when
                        iterative processes are involved. A common example is a function that calculates the factorial of a number:<br>
                        <strong>Callbacks</strong><br>
                        You’ll recall that they’re functions passed to other functions as arguments and then invoked inside the function they
                        are passed to.<br> 
                        <strong>Event-driven Asynchronous Programming</strong><br>
                        Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. JavaScript is a single-threaded environment,
                        which means only one piece of code will ever be processed at a time. This may seem like a limitation, but non-blocking
                        techniques can be used to ensure that the program continues to run.<br>
                        <strong>Callback Hell</strong><br>
                        <strong>Promises</strong><br>
                        A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don't do anything that can't already be
                        achieved using callbacks, but they help simplify the process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using
                        multiple callbacks.<br>
                        <I>The Promise Life Cycle</I><br>
                        When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to be pending. It remains in this state
                        while the operation is taking place. At this stage, the promise is said to be unsettled. Once the operation has
                        completed, the promise is said to have been settled. A settled promise can result in two different outcomes:<br>
                        Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.<br>
                        Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.<br>

                        <strong>Closures</strong><br>
                        Closures are one of JavaScript’s most powerful features, but they can be difficult to get your head around initially.<br>
                        <strong>Function Scope</strong><br>
                        <strong>Returning Functions</strong><br>
                        Functions declared from within another function have access to any variables declared in the outer function’s scope.
                        A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, maintaining access to any variables
                        declared inside the enclosing function.<br>
                        <strong>Functional Programming</strong><br>
                        Functional programming is a programming paradigm. Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented
                        programming and procedural programming. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, meaning that it can be used to program
                        in a variety of paradigms (and sometimes a mash-up of them!). This flexibility is an attractive feature of the language,
                        but it also makes it harder to adopt a particular coding style as the principles are not enforced by the language.<br>
                        <strong>Pure Functions</strong><br>
                        <strong>Higher-Order Functions</strong><br>
                        Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a
                        result, or both.Closures are used extensively in higher-order functions as they allow us to create a generic function that can be used
                        to then return more specific functions based on its arguments. This is done by creating a closure around a function's
                        arguments that keeps them 'alive' in a return function.
